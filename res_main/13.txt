Is that link for legal aid groups or NYS attorney general's office
my condo was listed for sale but not sure if it was postponed due to covid19
Will this go directly to the court so they can schedule me a court date ?
Fuck that is rather go roll a fat blunt thsbks for nothing
i just want to be sure im doing the right thing.
