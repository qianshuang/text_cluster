House in my deceased moms name and no mortgage paid .
She has a house with a mortgage and bank accounts I need access to.
Thank you. I am also interested in potentially buying the house. How can I find out what bank owns the mortgage?
The bank does not have to do anything with this. I'm applying for a mortgage and that item appeared.
Thanks, that's helpful.  Will the references you provided help her take action to get the mortgage in her name?
I am behind my mortgage and utility bills is there any ways I can get some help?
I tried paying my mortgage but they wouldn't take my money
I still pay all my mortgages and bills and they have not offer to help with nothing
I am a low income senior and need assistance re my home mortgage
The only other issue I’m dealing with in court is mortgage
i still have to pay my mortgage and I pay all their bills
He’s still paying the mortgage, etc
Housing mortgage I would need either way
My sister and brother in law were on the deed, the mortgage was in his name however I am the 1 that pays he mortgage.
i barely have any money leftover after i pay my mortgage.
