Which law office is the best to help me to get my stimulus check without more waiting? They are abusing their power !
They do not have the correct information and the took my hole stimulus. Check
One more question when is the stimulus check going to come
I am seeking legal advice regarding this pandemic , Stimulus check PEBT benefits and pandemic assistance program
Can you direct me on what form I can appeal the stimulus check?
I believe they took the whole stimulus check
Ok I thought there was but thought it was the stimulus check could not be garnished.
Yes sir I received my first stimulus payment the same way to the same address I did not change anything it was a paper check
Thanks. So, as long as my arrears are greater than $500 (which they are) - I should kiss goodbye to the stimulus check already?
