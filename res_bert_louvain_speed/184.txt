I am now have the concerns of agents coming through my place to do a Virtual videos .
I just need to know what site they use for virtual court
It is such short notice, and I have a little one on virtual learning etc.
My question is about my privacy concerns over a Virtual Video Touring
Do you know if virtual notary services are still allowed after 8/5?
I need a notary.  Do you know of any virtual notary services?
they said there was a place to set up an appointment for virtual assistance but I canâ€™t find that either
