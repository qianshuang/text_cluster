I have a hearing coming up I wasn't working and now I'm working do I have to let the judge know
Yes that's where I saw the judge that time
but am I wasting my time? would I be able to have a judge look it over?
each time I went to court to see the judge
maybe see if  a judge could do something
All I know is that I have to see the judge again next Thursday.
I need to see a judge how can I see one
thank you can you tell me the name of the last judge i spoke with
If i dnt get serverd should I tell the judge once I find out when court is
So i can just tell the judge that Iâ€™m not comfortable with it being lifted?
Hi I wanted to know if I have a hearing coming up.  Will the judge know I am working a new job.
