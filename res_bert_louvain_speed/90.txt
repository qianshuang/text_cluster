I appreciate your help.  I will start the claim as you advised.
DA was told me you can get free help and advise
He would like to get some questions answered.  Is there free legal advise he can get?
I just need legal advise. I don’t know if I should go with a lawyer.
who is advising me. but i think i want to get a lawyer to fight back
ok in this line do lawyers advise me on my specific case?
and should reconsider your profession. I am not asking for legal advise which you do not comprehend.
can you advise me of the forms I may need to submit? and tell me if it is too late for me to submit some?
ok i see. can you advise them i will come to their office today?
Yes, to be candid I am looking for free assistance or advise. Not sure if this is something you'd be able to help me with
What information would be pertinent to allow you to advise better?
Ok well if I type it out would do you think you would be able to help me with legal advise
It's a new case, am trying to get advise
Gotcha. Ok great. This was very helpful. Now we’ll read all you sent and go from there unless you have any other advise
How do I know if I am eligible to free legal advise?
I am actually looking for some legal advise but I am not sure if that would be here?
I think I need to be referred to legal advise just because I'm afraid I dont know much of what im doing
I’m not asking for legal advise I’m asking how the court system works. 2 different things but ok. Got it.
I have tried them numerous times over the years.  They always tell me they are unable to advise me for pro bono help.
I don't want advise thank you though.
