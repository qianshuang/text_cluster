Ok but can I submit a modification in another borough
Okay, so there's a chance that my son can submit his modification?
im not working anymore im on disability where can i submit a modification
He can even submit a modification because the courts are closed.
I think that's all I needed to know..in the mean time until the modification is submitted I cannot legally keep him from taking her?
