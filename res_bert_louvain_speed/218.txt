I already have an established child support payment , in need it to go through child support unit .
It would be an agreed average amount  of add on expenses. That could be paid monthly along with the child support
and judgement  came out she has to pay $200 week plus kids medical expenses of 50%
I wanted to know  how long after an increase in child support order is issued can it be paid out
I already have a court order for child support how can I have payment go through child support unit ?
