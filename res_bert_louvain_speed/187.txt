good morning , how can i go about getting a parent to sign over their parental rights
I wanted to know how long they have till they have to sign it
Ok I’ve read a lot but I also read he can just sign
Yes of course I sign it big and clear
If he agrees to sign over all rights and that is what I want as well, is that possible?
I want to sign over rights like we never existed
says he’s going to sign over his rights
