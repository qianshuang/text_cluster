As a custodial parent am I able to file a visitation petition in court against the non custodial parent to enforce visitation
Yes I know I can petition for it to be enforced, but I mean is it still enforceable by the violating party.
Only seeing the custody/visitation enforcement petition. Iâ€™m looking to start a petition not enforce one.
What must a person do to get a NY court to enforce a custody order that was started in NC?
when filing the petition will the order be enforced and will the non custodial be served
I used the DYI program for a petition to enforce a custody order- not I need to file it.
