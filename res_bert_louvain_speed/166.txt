Ok, I'll do that. Were you able to find any of the documents I was looking for?
I wanted to see how she should proceed with this and what documents she should complete
Iâ€™m not sure how else I can get these documents
Thank you, the last question I have is how do we go about it and what documentation do I need
Is there no other way to locate the orginal documents from the court case:
Will they be able to help me with creating a legal document?
Something needs to be done. I have documentation of everything
I just need direction navigating this site to find the documents
