i want to fill out a paternity request im not sure if after the dyi form is complete i need to have it notorized
What forms do I need to fill out to file a Paternity Petition?
i would like to find a lawyer or legal help and counsel on how to move forward in a fillation of Parternity Petition
I was filling out the form, it says the petition for paternity can be filed in the county of the mother, child , or myself
I fill out a  paternity  petition in the mail how long would it take to process
