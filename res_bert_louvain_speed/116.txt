I find one he said 1500 just to start
They are about to start evection process because they say we owe them $6000
thank you. I understand that $3000 is the limit, and I would be willing to go for that amount
I don't even get a 1000 a month
Yes I own Three months 3000 I have till the end of the month
and I paid a quarter of another months rent but owe $1000 still for that time
Is it legal mom write $15000 free gift exemption to others ?
i have to go to civil court figure out how to pay is 5000
after 5 year I moved they chargeed me $6000
My sister has a renter who skipped out on his rent and owes her over $3000. How do I try to recover this money?
I believe a bill was passed recommending a combined form wit $5000 gift limit
Ok but again I feel I can get 25000 from each party
I try to get help but was told need to pay $4000
