Correction i.meant to say that number is for scu.services.as well?
There is also a lot of DV history in my background.
i did but there is too much information. Do you know if it falls under DOB or FDNY ?
Okay, thank you.very much. The tty number.is also for scu?
so under these my circumstances I can go to FAP directly or only with ACS worker??
So, can I myself go to FAP today? or is ACS my liason to FAP.
