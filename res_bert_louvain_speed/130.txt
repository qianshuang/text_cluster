Hello, I would like to know information about submiting a custudy petition form
Iâ€™m just trying to be clear. Okay so the petition submitted is enough?
and what happens if during this wait period, the other parent submits a petition too
do I have to submit a petition in NYS supreme court or NYC courts?
I submitted petition with the G1 form and g17 attached , and i was still informed that they are currently not accepting petitions
I tried to submit a complaint threw the precinct but was told I need the petition order
Do I have to submit another petition because of his age? The initial petition was because of the marriage
are you able to walk me through how to submit a petition to the court during these times of covid?
can i still submit my petition on Friday you think or will that be a waste of time?
So in the court website I'm not able to submit the petition?
Being that courts are closed is there a way to submit a petition
