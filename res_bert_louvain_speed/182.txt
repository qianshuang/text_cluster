ok so just to confirm with you, I can email the application and documents to that email you provided
yes thank you, I called the number you gave me and he gave my another email in which I submit my application, so thank you
I submitted an application weeks ago and have not received an update or any information regarding the application
would I be able to file it online and submit the application
I submitted form I-90 but the case is taking too long
are you allowed to tell me the time for the electronic application submission?
Is there an application i can submit before the case due date?
