By any law is the father that is paying for child support need to provide health insurance for the child?
the law regarding health insurance for children under 21
I have a disabled child and an existing child support order. I’m looking for assistance regarding health insurance and his extensive medical needs.
sure! child health insurance was changed without any notification.
as a parent do I have to cover my child’s health insurance to age 26
