Do you have a email address or an alternate phone number that I can reach them at?
if I can't reach them over phone or email, can I just go to legal aid society to seek help?
I'm going to try these now.  Is there any way I can get back to you if I have a problem reaching them?
since march Im trying to reach them
I've tried to contact them can't seem to reach them
Ok are you able to give me their phone number to reach them
When I try to call the number it says I can’t reach them
Yes no problem. What happens if we get disconnected? How do I reach you?
Yes, tried calling them but cannot reach anyone
thank yoiu, I have been unable to reach anyone on the phone
Ok, is there also a phone number I can reach some one at?
No worries. Is there a phone number may I may reach a lawyer in your office for legal aid?
Thank you so much - do you have another number in case I can’t reach anyone?
