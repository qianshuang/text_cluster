So I file first and wait for a hearing date?
I have court hearing soon I need free legal help
I am supposed to attend a hearing on the matter tomorrow.
I did not have a court hearing for it....was issued 3 years ago
Iâ€™ve called for a fair hearing and no numbers work
since NYC is reopening, I am sure my hearing will be very soon now then
any Insights on the May 12 hearing in terms of what to expect???
Okay and then the person would just bring the forms in with them to the hearing?
the up coming hearing is called a Permanency hearing
I called them up they gave me a hearing already in September
the court hearing had already taken place and she has gotten an official OP after that.
That was supposed to be the resource concerning preparation for a fair hearing.
And today I saw that, fact finding for the next hearing in September
