but the fact that she asked for this, doesn't that show her character? would the judge care to see it?
I immediately brought it to judge's attention and asked for date but it didn't get set until now which is 5-11
but in the future how am i going to do this? without lawyers. what can I ask the judge for?
so how does it work? Does the judge ask for it at our next appearance, or are they supposed to already have it?
Yes I need an extension but I don't know how I'm suppose to ask the judge for one.
