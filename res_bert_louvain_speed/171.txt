Ok so do I need to try and schedule a court date ?
I'm ready to schedule on the court calendar
I am just trying to schedule an online court date
Schedule is not set yet. Going to court tomorrow to get a date.
because I canâ€™t work the schedule they set forth.
Will this go directly to the court so they can schedule me a court date ?
Good day. How do I schedule a court date for child support?
Do you know what date the courts are scheduled to open back up?
