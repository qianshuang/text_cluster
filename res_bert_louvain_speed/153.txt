Okay and that was supposed to say that my lease expires today
SO she says this covers us and we can leave with proper notice before the lease ends
Thank you! In this case I’m allowed at lease 90 day since I’ve lived there as of feb 8th 4 years.
my lease permits me to take possession of the apartment after 3 days.
But on the other hand why mention 45 days notice if the lease if for 1 year
Is it true that when our current lease with expires and we still occupy, it becomes a month to month with the same terms?
good evening i have a question im on the FEPS Program my lease ends 4/3/2020 whats do i need to do now?
I've been to the 1st link but it does not address the month to month once lease expires.
i live in a rent stabilized apt and my lease expires in april 2020.
She says this lets us leave with 45 days notice even thought the lease term is one year
