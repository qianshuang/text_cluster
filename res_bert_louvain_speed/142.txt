Since me and my husband signed on the lease already, is the lease is valid? Even without the owner’s signature?
We only have 6 days before we move in but the lease still not signed by the owner or landlord.
My name is on the lease, I signed the papers to get rid of the apartment.
Intent was to move into apartment in April and a lease was signed but no physical paperwork given.
in addition although I signed the lease I have yet to receive a copy with the owner’s signature
I need legal advice regarding a new lease that my landlord is forcing me to sign
I signed the lease back in July with a friend
We had signed a lease for an apartment before the new laws were in effect.
i rented in june 2019 (signed the lease in april 2019)
Yes, it is a mobile home park and I never signed a lease. 26 yrs.
