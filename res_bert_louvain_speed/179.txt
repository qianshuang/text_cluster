Courts are currently closed due to COVID
Courts are closed at the moment due to COVID- 19
noted.  Are the courts operating now? I know due to the COVID they were closed
due to covid courts were closed for my court dates do you know if they are reopened
So how would I go down to the courts if all courts are closed due to covid-19
ok - Can all of this be done online since the courts are closed due to Covid 19?
this is a problem due to covid and the courts being closed
