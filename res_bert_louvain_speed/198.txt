I get $50.00 a week in child support for two children. the last order was back in 2013 and their father wasnt making much then.
And our child support case is done, they are already taking money out of my check
I need advice because my child father is harassing me and once proof that I've been spending money on my child on child support
she came back to me in May of this year and they are still taking out child support
YES.I was never married to the mother, Child support office is collecting the money
Yes and the mother was still getting the child support money.
