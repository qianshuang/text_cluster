I'm one year into a two year lease
I signed a 1 year lease and I want to get off it what is the best way to do so
Thank you, but there is no lease, currently month to month
I have a two year lease that does not end until 2022
no they just taking advantage because they lease was upp in may 2020
We are only in our 6th month of 1 year lease**
And lease to a friend until the lease is up in July 21?
It was a 1 year lease ending in August 31
