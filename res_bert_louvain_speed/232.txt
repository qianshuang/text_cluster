I contacted family and surrogacy court and they could help me
should i contact family court on this for filing order?
Do you have a phone number  i can call at the Brooklyn Family Court ?
No but thank  you I will try and contact the family court where the order is in place
So I should contact the family court in NJ first to see what they say basically
