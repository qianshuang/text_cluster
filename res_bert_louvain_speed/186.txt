and yes, also, can you tell me where for sure to send the paperwork
Okay. How long does the process normally take from me sending in the paperwork to getting a letter with a court date?
can you send me a link to the correct paperwork I would need to file.
so if u can tell me weâ€™re to get that paperwork or send me it that be great
I dont know how long a delay would be sending by mail being no one is in to process the paperwork
also because I want to know if I can send his mother the paperwork?>
and is this the address to send the paperwork to? i am located in queens county.
