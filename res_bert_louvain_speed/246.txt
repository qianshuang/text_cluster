do they have attorneys who represent people in such cases?  i am disabled, low income, my experience with them is they don't do representation
Also the names of the attorneys who represented each parent.
I'm look for an attorney to represent me in a small claims matter.
And in terms of the counsel that could represent him in business matter?
do you know of any attorneys in the Rockland area who are willing to represent defendants in legal malpractice cases?
