cant seem to know what to do and they have suspended his license due to this
I am on probation 6 months with a suspended license but I was found driving with a suspended license
I received a letter stating my license will be suspended in 45 days because of arrears
Definitely I don't want to suspend his driving license, or else he can't make a living.
I need a court date before my permit is suspended
so my license was suspended last year, and I just knew about it because my license was up
can I request the court not to suspend his driving license.
My license has been suspended because the added amount to my arrears
I am earning very little money at work I have not paid for 5 months, my license was suspended
I am on probation For 3 years and 6 months suspended license I was just found driving with a suspended license
