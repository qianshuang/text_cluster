Ok thank you. I have court appearance Nov 4th @10a.m in Monroe County child support court.
Thank you guess I was just wondering if it’s legal ... to appear in a different state court than where you reside
Is the person being served suppost to go appear in front of a judge when they get the papers?
How do I file a g f 29 which is a notice of appearance
How does one person go about requesting a court apperence in Family Court for not appearing to their Order of Protection summons
Thank you so much. Also it appears it will not allow me to check the link while our chat is still going.

Although my incompitent lawyers sent me a notice to appear
there is no date to appear, it just says I have 20 days?
And now wants to adopt  the child , and  they had two court appearances
OF COURSE WHY WOULD YOU ASK TO APPEAR AFTER THEY GIVE THE ORDER
The maternal Grandmother is in Florida and cannot appear in person and so needs to request to testify electronically/by phone

where can I find that form and do I need to appear in court
I’m looking to apply for a phone appearance because I’m out of state

I obtained Sole custody because the other parents failed to appear at all of the court dates.
He filed the petition for custody. I was mailed a summons to appear in court. He did not receive any instruction to appear.
He is not arguing, and he want to appear. He was surprised the summons was mailed to me, but he was not notified prior
what can I do to let the court know that I won't be able to appear
Not sure if I’ll be getting it at my next court appearance.
And this for anyone to fill out ? Appears to be geared towards attorneys
so if she wastes time and never appears and its been 6 months or more... that means Ny loses jurisdiction?
Or should I just focus on it from the modification angle...I don’t want to appear to be ignoring these letters.
