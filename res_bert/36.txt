Thnk you, I actually did 2 nights ago (monday night) 6.22.20
My job hasn't given me any hours in 2 weeks but has given her daughter my hours. Is that fair
The first one was while we were still in court. I believe the first access was in February and the second one was last weekend.
In august I started working part time and I give her $200 cash every two weeks
and im entitled to a monthly check untill 65 of age
my son is 11. she has him home alone until she gets home on her weeks.
I still always picked him up regularly since then
Good evening Charles, and happy new year

I just wanted to know if I have any rights.....I sometimes work 80 hours  a week, with no extra pay or days off.
She got a stay away order and I‚Äôve been away from my house for 6 months
Yes that would be great because I already called them andcouldnt get thru
He doesnt stay more than 3 days, now he's here a little over week.
after the three months have expired which would be january
i would say most likely the end of feb

im just afraid i wont be able to see my kid till shes 18 and thats along time from 15
I have 10 days notice and it already past 4 days
we agreed on having the kid one week me and the other week her.. but now she is not letting me have my kid
i feel like i missed some deadlines but hoping it's still possible
Since we have been here in CT he is seeing him this weekend for the first time
the whole point of me working overnights was so that I can take care of my things in the morning
I have a scheduled examination before trial on next Friday
Ok so u mentioned June 18th. Therefore it was extended?
i said no that ill give her to him from last saturday to next thursdy
I have been driving all day to place to place and no one is helping thanks

I asked if I could take my one granddaughter out for her 16th birthday and she never replied
I gave up my rights in 2017 and now I want them back
I work the late night shifts and this has just been so overwhelming.

There's no specific time frame mentioned
She has lived all her life in NY... and she has been missing less than a month. The 8th will be a month actually.
made it hard to work correctly and put a lot of stress on me especially because I was communicated with off the clock a lot.
During the week of March 16 thru March 29 my mom had my daughter at our home
The 3 one came to me in March 2020
They resided with me for one year and prior to this they were always at my home every other weekend
I'll have to keep reading what the time frame is he has

and she is in agreement to let him come home as well
I have caled those places over the last 5 years they wont help me
so they still dont know an exact date?
He has been gone since 9/2019 til present
whether I am entitled to a 30, 60 or 90 day notice
Not sure of exact month but I believe it was March or April 2017
they didn't process april payment. .so they wanted april.and .may
he said by the end of the month., so i still have some time
I know i should go to court, but i don't have the time to because of my work hour's

are there any locations that are open for in person appointments so i can get one on one help?
Can an employer give away my shifts even if they are already scheduled?
If you want to schedule a one-off consultation with her and me, that is fine -- doesn't have to wait for the next Bloomberg day.
